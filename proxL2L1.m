function out = proxL2L1( in, t, weights )
  % out = proxL2L1( in, t [, weights ] )
  %
  % Returns the proximal operator of f(x) = t * weights .* L2L1( x ), where
  %   L2L1 is the (possibly weighted) L2,L1 norm.
  %
  % Inputs:
  % in - three dimensional array
  % thresh - the thresholding value
  %
  % Optional Inputs:
  % weights - the weights of the norm (should it be weighted)
