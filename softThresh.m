function out = softThresh( in, thresh )
  % out = softThresh( in, thresh )
  %
  % Applies the proximal operator of the L1 norm (proxL1)
  %
  % Note that this functionality for real inputs is implemented by Matlab
  % with the wthresh function, but it is part of the Wavelet Toolbox.  If
  % you don't have that toolbox, then this function will work fine.  :)
  %
  % Inputs:
  % in - scalar or array
  % thresh - the soft thresholding value
