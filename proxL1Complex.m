function out = proxL1Complex( in, thresh, weights )
  % out = proxL1Complex( in, thresh [, weights ] )
  %
  % Returns the proximal operator of f(x) = thresh * L1( x ), where
  %   x is a complex vector.
  %
  % Inputs:
  % in - an array of complex values
  % thresh - the thresholding value
  %
  % Optional Inputs:
  % weights - an array of size in specifying threshold scaling factor
  %   for each component
