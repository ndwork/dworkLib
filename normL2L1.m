function out = normL2L1( in, varargin )
  % out = normL2L1( in, [ 'ws', ws ] )
  %
  % Calculates the L_{2,1} norm of the input.  It is assumed that
  % the last dimension of in represents the groups
  %
  % Inputs:
  % in: a multi-dimensional array.  The last dimension of in represents
  %     the groups.  That is, the L2 norm is calculated on the last dimension
  %
  % Optional Inputs:
  % ws: weights for a weighted L1 norm
  %
  % Outputs:
  % out: a scalar value greater than or equal to 0
