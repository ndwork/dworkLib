function dists = findDistsBetweenPtsAndLine( pts, line )
  % dist = findDistBetweenPtsAndLine( pts, line )
  %
  % Inputs:
  % pts - a MxN real array specifying the coordinates of the points
  %   M is the dimension of the space; N is the number of points
  % line - a structure containing two elements: pt and vec
  %   line.pt is a point on the line
  %   line.vec is a vector that points in the direction of the line
  %
  % Outputs:
  % dists - a 1D array representing the shortest distance between the points and the line
